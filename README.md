# dance moves
a python script that downloads videos and edit them automatically to get a short video for each dance move of about 5s

This is the branch for the github pages website.
You can download and open it locally on your machine, but if you want the custom video player to work
you will need to run a local server as the youtube api does not allow running locally without a server

* in the command line move to the decompressed folder containing the file of this branch 
* run *python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000*
* you can then access to the website locally by putting the adress *0.0.0.0:8000* in a browser
