{"name":"Lindy hop moves","tagline":"a python script that downloads videos and edit them automatically to get a short video for each Lindy Hop dance move of about 5s","body":"# Lindy Hop Moves Videos Maker\r\nThis project contains a python script that downloads videos from *youtube* and edit them automatically to create on your computer a short video file of about 5s for each Lindy Hop move listed [here](listmoves.md). You can transfer these video files to your smartphone and watch them whenever you forgot the details of a move.\r\n\r\nThis project somehow complements the website http://www.lindysteps.com that does not provide a way to download edited version of the video on a mobile.\r\n\r\n## Mobile Video Players \r\n\r\n* Using the application *AVPlayer* on android you can loop the video until you fully understand the move.\r\n* Using the *VLC player* on android you can visualize a video in slow motion.\r\n\r\n##Existing moves\r\n\r\nYou can consult the list of moves [here](listmoves.md).\r\nYou can add moves by editing this file if you are a collaborator.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Windows installation\r\n\r\n* install python from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/python-2.7.10.amd64.msi.\r\n* download the zip file of the project [here] (https://github.com/martinGithub/lindy_hop_moves/archive/master.zip) an decompress it \r\n* double click on *setup.py*, this will install automatically the dependencies (*youtube-dl* and *libav*). \r\n\r\n### Mac OS installation\r\n\r\n* install python from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/python-2.7.10-macosx10.6.pkg (note that recent version of Mac OS X should comes with Python 2.7 out of the box)\r\n* download the zip file of the project [here] (https://github.com/martinGithub/lindy_hop_moves/archive/master.zip) an decompress it \r\n* in the terminal, move in the decompressed folder using the *cd* command (for example *cd ~/Downloads/lindy_hop_moves-master* if that where it has been decompressed) and type *sudo python setup.py*, this will install automatically the dependencies (*youtube-dl* and *ffmpeg*)\r\n* you can now select *PythonLauncher* as the default application to open python scripts  through the *finder Info window*\r\n\r\n### Linux (Ubuntu) installation \r\n\r\n* download the zip file of the project [here] (https://github.com/martinGithub/lindy_hop_moves/archive/master.zip) an decompress it \r\n* in the terminal, move in the decompressed folder and type *sudo python setup.py*, this will install automatically the dependencies (*youtube-dl* and *libav*)\r\n\r\n## Execution\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to run the script you can either \r\n\r\n*  double-click on *download_lindy_moves.py* in Windows and Mac OS (assuming you have setup PythonLauncher as the default application for python scripts in Mac OS) \r\n\r\n* open a terminal on Mac OS or Linux, or the [command prompt](http://www.7tutorials.com/7-ways-launch-command-prompt-windows-7-windows) in Windows, then move to the decompressed folder using the *cd* command and then call *python download_lindy_moves.py*. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy default the original youtube videos and the edited videos will be created respectively in the subfolders *edited_videos* and *original_videos*. You can change that by editing *download_lindy_moves.py* or you can create local symbolic links with this names that link to folder located somewhere else in the system.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\nUsing OpenCV we could improve the quality of the videos by running some video stabilisation method, background substraction and contrast enhancement.\r\nWe could also denoise the sound on some videos.\r\nWe could use avconvert when executed on Mac OS (from OS X Lion) to avoid the installation of libav or ffmpeg.\r\n\r\n## GIFS\r\n\r\n\r\n![Image](http://cdn.yourepeat.com/media/gif/002/499/901/1c9742f5c51469acb193029dcdf6e58e.gif?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
